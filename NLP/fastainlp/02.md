# 奇异值分解

Lemmatization is the process of converting a word to its base form. The difference between stemming and lemmatization is, lemmatization considers the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form, whereas stemming just removes the last few characters, often leading to incorrect meanings and spelling errors.

SVD is not nearly as famous as it should be.

The SVD algorithm factorizes a matrix into one matrix with orthogonal columns and one with orthogonal rows (along with a diagonal matrix, which contains the relative importance of each factor).
